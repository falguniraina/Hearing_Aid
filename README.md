# Hearing_Aid
Build the following:

Desktop layout: https://res.cloudinary.com/dhqvlsb3l/image/upload/v1612949147/lp_fe_coding_challenge/mockup_desktop.png

Mobile layout: https://res.cloudinary.com/dhqvlsb3l/image/upload/v1612949146/lp_fe_coding_challenge/mockup_mobile.png

Data: https://www.hear.com/in/horizon/

For the data, create a JSON containing a list of hearing aid devices, from the URL shared above and the section shared in the screenshot. The layout of the design for the products should be similar to as shown in the screenshot creating both desktop and mobile designs


Behaviour:
Each button is clickable and will have an active state when selected;
On click, the image & text in the header should change - according to the data from the JSON;
Use Left & Right keyboard arrows to navigate between elements;
The current selection should be pushed to a URL parameter: ‘aud_device’. As value for this parameter, please use the key of each device (ex: aud_device=ricS);
If a device is already passed as a URL parameter - when the page loads, it should be preselected;
You can choose the mobile / desktop breakpoints.

Acceptance criteria:
Vanilla Js (no frameworks);
Cross-browser optimized (page should work correctly in Chrome, IE & Safari).
Animate the transition between elements;
